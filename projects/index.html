<p>This page lists several of the projects I have worked on before/am working on.</p>
<h1>3D "Block World" Game</h1>
<p>A working, simple game made for a final year uni group assignment. Demonstrates several graphical effects, including reflections and procedurally generated textures. The game world is generated randomly at the start of each game.</p>

<p>The plan is for the game to be open sourced after a review of the code.</p>
